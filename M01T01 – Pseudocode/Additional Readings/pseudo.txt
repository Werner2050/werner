An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered. 


set largest_number = 0

Repeat
	print "Enter positive number (or 0 to stop): "
`	read number

	if number > largest_number then
		set largest_number TO number
	end if

until number = 0

print "The largest number entered was: " + largest_number




An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”. 



request user's first_name

print first_name, " Hello World"



An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average. 


set sum to 0
set count to 0

print "Enter an integer (or type 'done' to finish)
read input

if input is not "done" then
	convert input to number
	add number to sum
	increment count by 1

end if

until input is "done" 

if count > 0 then
	set average to sum / count
	print "The arithmetic average is: ", average
else
	print "No numbers were entered."





An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy. 



create empty list called grocery_list
create empty list called bought_items

print "Enter grocery items one by one (type "done" to finish)"
repeat
	read item 
	if item does not = "done" then
	add item to grocery_list
	end if 
until item = "done"

print "Enter items that you have bought (type "done" to finish)"
repeat
	read buy
	if buy does not = "done" then
	add bought to bought_items
	end if
until bought = "done" 

create empty list in called items_left
	for each item in grocerist_ do 
	if item not in bought_items then
	add item to items left

sort items_lef in alphabetical order 

print "Items still left to buy:" 
	for each items in items_left do display item 



● An algorithm for the flowchart on the following page:


print "Enter value for X"
read X

print "Enter value for Y"
read Y

set S = X + Y
set A = S / 2
set P = X * Y

print S, A and P
